# RC2014 Tandy Sound Card

This is a sound card for the RC2014 that I've been tinkering with, it's based on
the SN76489N chip so it should be something akin to the original Tandy Sound Card.
Not that I actually had one of those, I was lucky enough to have a computer in the
early 90s and that was years before I managed to get a hold of my first used sound
card (Creative Soundblaster 8-bit). Anyways, I digress...

# Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a starting
point for ordering PCBs, the schematic is also available in
[PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/RC2014/raw/master/RC2014%20Tandy%20Sound%20Card/export/RC2014%20Tandy%20Sound%20Card.pdf).

# BOM
To be specified when I figure out what works, if any of it.
