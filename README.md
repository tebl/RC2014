# RC2014

I've been spending a lot of time lately working on extensions to the excellent RC2014 machine, check out the official web page at [http://rc2014.co.uk](http://rc2014.co.uk) if you're not familiar with it. Short story; it's a Z80-based homecomputer that you can build yourself using a soldering iron, lots of time and severely burned fingers. A lot of fun indeed!

I've been documenting the build process of the various components on my blog at [https://hvetebolle.blogspot.no/p/rc2014.html](https://hvetebolle.blogspot.no/p/rc2014.html), but take note that it's in my native language of Norwegian so it might not register as readable for most people.

## Modules

I'll be making a subfolder for each of the modules I've been working on, most of the files will be in KiCad format so you'll need this open source application installed if you intend to work with the schematics. For the most part I will include the necessary Gerber files (for PCB production) in each modules export folder, the schematic in PDF-format will also probably be included - also, in the export folder.
